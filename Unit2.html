    <h3 class="fonth3">1.1. Describing the content and layout for each page.</h3>
    <p class=fontpara>The main concept of my website was to divide it into 8-10 separate pages and organise them strategically, according to the certain aspects of my private and professional life being driven primarily by my passion for the Korean culture and phillanthropic work. I also wanted my website to reflect my global character, leadership, and target-driven personality. Therefore, I started from presenting my personal attributes in the “About me” section first, followed by my voluntary work in the DPRK (“Charity”) and “Disability and Technology” sections, which were meant to show my entrepreneurial and progressive thinking seeking creative new solutions for the problems existing in the developing world. Whereas, the answers to the assignment questions from the Unit 1 and Unit 2 as well as my references and contact details were placed at the very end of my website due to their more informative character, and not requiring an extensive graphic content, e.g. photos. In contrast, the first 4 sections contain several photos on them (average 5-10) between a text, depending on the content presented, and page’s layout and its aesthetic value.

    <h3 class="fonth3">1.5. Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h3>
    <p class="fontpara">The website developers are obliged to obey the Copyright Act, preventing them from copying, reproducing, preparing derivative works, public performing, and public displaying someone else’s work as their own without obtaining a license from a copyright holder first. [8] However, the distribution right is limited by the "first sale doctrine", meaning that the copyright holder does not have the rights to object a distribution process of his work once it is sold. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Other constraints affecting websites is their accessibility on different devices, such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, and enabling a full display of all objects of a webpage such as text, graphs, pictures, etc. on a viewer’s screen, regardless of the device used. Additionally, ensuring the size of all objects of the webpage to remain in the same proportion while zooming in different browsing environments can be a challenge and may affect the overall user experience. [9]

    <h3 class="fonth3">1.6. Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. </h3>
<p class="fontpara">The access to web content by people with a wide range of disabilities [10], such as vision impairment (e.g. partial, full or colour blindness), hearing problems, physical difficulties (e.g. cerebral palsy or lack of limbs), and limited cognitive ability can be an issue for them while working online independently and should be considered by web developers.
    <br>
    <br>
    Therefore, the use of an assistive, adaptive, and accessible technology [11] is highly encouraged while creating the online content, e.g. by enabling zooming in and out of a web content, facilitating a colour blind mode, incorporating an audio content for partially or fully blind people, or allowing a voice recognition and navigation through a webpage for people with movement disorders and not being able to use neither a computer mouse or keyboard.

    <h3 class="fonth3">1.7. Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.</h3></div>
    <p class="fontpara"> 
        The appropriate file types to be used for websites are:
        <br>
        Document: .pdf, .doc, .png [13]
        <br>
        Multiple files: .zip [13]
        <br>
        Logos: .png, .svg [13]
        <br>
        Image: .jpg, .png, .tif [12]
        <br>
        Animated images: .gif [13]
